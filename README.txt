To run this program, start up the server followed by the 2 clients. The client will start with its host name and port number already filled out. Connect to the server using IP 127.0.0.1 and port number 8080. Fill out the rest as you see fit and hit connect. You should now be connected to the server. Check the terminal to make sure.
        Once you are connected, you can search for the key words of a file. For my example, I search “sample” and “for” to bring up the different files in the directory. The client 1 directory has the same files for client 2 except “something.txt”. This is done to demo the retrieval system. 
        To retrieve the file, you must first connect to the other client. At the bottom of the GUI, type “connect hostname portnumber”. This connects you to the other client. Then type “retr something.txt” to retrieve the file. Then type quit to disconnect from the other client. You can now check the client 1 directory to see that something.txt has been downloaded.
